# National Causal Studies
This is the data repository for public available code and data to reproduce analyses in "Evaluating the Potential Causal Impact of Long-term Exposure to Fine Particulate Matter on Mortality Among the Elderly."

<b>Code: </b><br>
[`data_process.R`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/National_Causal/blob/master/data_process.R) includes the code to extract all necessary data and prepocess data for statistical analyses.

[`statistical_models.R`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/National_Causal/blob/master/statistical_models.R) includes the code to implement all five statistical models, including two tranditional methods (i.e., Cox proportional hazard model and Cox-equvalent conditional Poisson model), and three causal inference methods (i.e., adjustment, weighting and matching by genealized propensity scores).

[`covariate_balance.R`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/National_Causal/blob/master/covariate_balance.R) includes the code to assess covariate balance for two causal inference methods (i.e., weighting and matching by genealized propensity scores).

[`death_saved.R`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/National_Causal/blob/master/death_saved.R) includes the code to calculate the total number of deaths that would be avoided among the elderly per decade if all areas were in compliance with the current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (i.e., 10 Î¼g/m3 annual PM2.5 exposure).

[`pm_map.R`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/National_Causal/blob/master/pm_map.R),[`ScienceAdvances_main.R`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/National_Causal/blob/master/ScienceAdvances_main.R),[`ScienceAdvances_supp.R`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/National_Causal/blob/master/ScienceAdvances_supp.R) includes the code to generate figures in Main Text and Supplementary Materials.

[`Bootstrap`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/National_Causal/tree/master/Bootstrap) contains code to calculate the Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals for all five statistical models.
